# CPP.ImageEncoder

<img src="readme-assets/icons/name.png" alt="Project Icon" width="750">

This program encodes text in a bitmap image (.bmp). It works by using LSB
steganography which is the process of modifying the least significant bit
of a pixel to store part of a character.


## Define application constants
The default values for kHeaderSize, kFooterSize and kMaxSecretLen are
1024. This can be changed with minimal impact on the program

- kHeaderSize
The minimum value that I would recommend setting this to would be 256.
After a quick look on Wikipedia, it looks like anywhere between 16 and
196 bytes are required for the header. Setting it at 256 or higher
seems safe.

- kFooterSize
It doesn't look like a bitmap has a footer. This was included for .jpg
images. Play around with it if you would like but there is certainly no
harm in leaving it at the default value

- kMaxSecretLen
This was included to stop the python version crashing. Though it has the
added benefit of outputting a reasonable amount of text to the screen.
Using larger values will decrease the speed of the program, and increase
the amount of text outputted but shouldn't have an adverse effect

- kCleanImageName
I've done an MD5 hash of "CLEAN" and appended it to the filename to reduce
the chance of overwriting an important file

## Functions
Read image file in
```cpp
FILE* ReadImg(std::string image_name)
```
Write image file
```cpp
FILE* WriteImg(std::string image_name)
```
Get the size of the image in bytes to prevent overwriting footer
```cpp
int GetSize(std::string image_name)
```
Replace the least significant bit with a 0
```cpp
int WriteCleanImg(std::string input_image_name, std::string output_image_name)
```
Write a secret message to the image
```cpp
int WriteEncodedImg(std::string input_image_name, std::string output_image_name,
	std::string secret_msg)
```
Read the encoded image
```cpp
int ReadEncodedImg(std::string input_image_name)
```
The CLI
```cpp
int Cli()
```

## Using the CLI
"Clean, Encode, Clean and Encode (.bmp only), Decode or Quit?
(C, e, a, d, q)"

- Entering 'c' will clean an image (specified by its path)
- Entering 'e' will encode an image (specified by its path)
- Entering 'a' will clean and encode an image (specified by its path)
- Entering 'd' will decode an image (specified by its path)
- Entering 'q' will quit the program

"Type the name of the input image (include the file extension
and path if required)"

- Enter the path to an input image

"Type the name of the output image (include the file extension
and path if required)"

- If the user selected Clean, Encode, or Clean and Encode. Enter
the path of an output image

"Type the secret message (max kMaxSecretLen characters)"

- If the user selected Encode, or Clean and Encode. Enter a message
for the program to encode in the image
